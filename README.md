# Enterprise Architecture
A blueprint for the optimal and target-conformant placement of resources in the IT environment for the ultimate support of the business function.

 * Affects all development of the company.
 * Works with high-level abstractions of the created systems.
 * Provides technical communications throughout the company.
 * Does not interact with the code.
 * Focuses on the business component.
 * Has a broad technological horizon.
 * Owns several domains.

# The Concept of Enterprise Architecture

# Levels of Enterprise Architecture.
Enterprise Architect has a number of powerful features that will assist the architecture program to partition and maintain these levels of the architecture and their inter-relationships.

 * **Strategic Architectures**: Provides a high level and often long term view of the enterprise and are used by senior business and technical stackholders to get a single view of the architecture to assist with strategic planning.
 * **Tactical Architectures**: Provide a mid-range view of the enterprise often focused on a particular area or division and provides the context for operational changes and equates to the portfolio or program level organization of projects and initiatives.
 * **Solution Architectures**: Provide a detailed view of how an enterprise can support a capability and how the parts of the architecture can be used to describe baseline and target capabilites and capability increments. These architectures will typically guilde projects that are grouped within a portfolio.

Enterprise Architect can be used to define and manage strategic level architectures and can also help to ensure tactical and solution architectures are aligned to support the strategic direction. 

This diagram shows the way architecture at different levels can be visualized.

# The Role of Enterprise Architecture Practice

# Four Stages of Architecture Maturity
  1. **Business Silios**: where companies look to maximize individual business unit needs or functional needs.
  2. **Standardized Technology**: providing IT efficientcies through technology standardization and, in most cases, increased centralization of technology management.
  3. **Optimized Core**: which provides companywide data & process standardization as appropriate for the operating model.
  4. **Business Modularity**: where companies manage and reuse loosely IT-enabled business process components to preserve global standards while enable local differences.

# Types of IT Initiatives
## Fundamentals
## Stategic
### Strategic Planning 
Strategic planning process alone neither delivers any IT solutions nor even describes what exactly needs to be delivered, but only provides high-level rules and directions for IT reflected in Considerations and Visions agreed by both business and IT.
### Initiative Delivery
Is the next downstream process which turns the abstract plans into tangible IT solutions implemented in an optimal manner. It closes the gap between Strategic planning and the actual practical implementation of working IT solutions.

### The Process View in Practice
![EA process view](./src/eaprocessview.PNG)
This figure suggests, an EA practive cannot be viewed as a single step-by-step process, where architects creates numerious EA artifacts to describe all the layers of architecture from busienss to infrastructure, but rather as a complex set of diverse and interacting processes happening simultaneously organizational levels.

# Architecture Roadmap
Is a lists of individual work packages that will realize the Target Architecture and lays them out on a timeline to show progression from the Baseline Architecture to the Target Architecture. The Architecture Roadmap highlights individual work packages' business value at each stage. Transition Architectures necessary to effectively realize the Target Architecture are identified as intermediate steps.

A few lessons learnt while rolling out the process:
 1. **Focus on the basics and stay grounded**: Well defined roadmaps abstract the details while highlighting significant capabilities, However, while reviewing roadmaps across an organization, Architects should examine and synch up the details.
 2. **Plan for a continuum of reviews**: Business domains evolve, strategies get updated, and new capabilities are periodically introduced in organizations. Therefore, the roadmaps will periodically become obsolete, and must be updated and reconciled.
 3. **Stakeholder engagement**: Reconciling roadmaps at a large organization does not happen in isolation. One must engage Architects and stakeholders from across functional and business boundaries which may present logistical challenges. Engaging teams that are geographically dispersed will require consulting and change management skills.  
 4. **Consultative more than directive**: A roadmap review should take into account organizational (human) dynamics and organizational constraints. The reviews and reconciliation should be consultative, although some aspects - like external vendor inputs or Technology Debt - may have to be directive.
