# Four Stages of Architecture Maturity
  1. **Business Silios**: where companies look to maximize individual business unit needs or functional needs.
  2. **Standardized Technology**: providing IT efficientcies through technology standardization and, in most cases, increased centralization of technology management.
  3. **Optimized Core**: which provides companywide data & process standardization as appropriate for the operating model.
  4. **Business Modularity**: where companies manage and reuse loosely IT-enabled business process components to preserve global standards while enable local differences.
